# turbo-album

### What is this all about?

**turbo-album** is a placeholder name for a new project that aims to become the de-facto best art organizer tool out there and most importantly, a tool I will enjoy using myself.

#### Problem

Over the last couple of years, I've found myself trudging through the garbage heap of art files on my hard drive. Duplicates, nameless files, formats that require me to wait for Photoshop to open to even see what they are, I had it all. I wished I had some kind of tool that would let me simplify the task or organizing all my art files and provide me with an easier way to browse and search through them. This tool aims to accomplish just that.

#### MVP

The minimum viable product should include these features:
- A built-in file browser (duh)
- A basic file info and preview screen
- A rudimentary search function
- Basic file operations, such as cut, copy, move, rename, etc.

#### Technology

The MVP will be made with **Svelte** and **Electron**, as I currently lack the skills to implement the features required with other languages and libraries. Performance is key when working with files, so future decisions will depend on how the MVP performs. I will very likely consider switching to **Tauri**, or maybe an entirely different ecosystem as a whole once I have the core features implemented and working.

#### What can I do?

If you're interested in this project you're always welcome to join as a tester, a developer, or even as a designer! Contact me directly or through the GitHub issue tracker if you wish to contribute! 

#### Footnotes

I am currently in the process of moving, after which Im starting my first year in Uni, so this project will by no means be finished quick. I'll try my best to keep up with development and user support. Same goes for all my other projects.
